This Mod includes the V-Meter, Difficulty tracking, FPS detection, In-Game Timers and ChaosMod all in one neat package.
You can toggle these features under "Game Options" in the "Options" menu. The Mod also has some customization options regarding the HUD, nothing too major however. Changes take effect after restarting the level.

# Installation
1. Download the mod from release page.
2. Unzip it into your CoD4 "Mods" folder located in the root of your game folder. You should now have a folder called "EverythingInOne" in the "Mods" folder.
3. Open the README.TXT. Copy&Paste the needed Dvars into your config file. If you have previously installed EverythingInOne, you do not need all of the Dvars, just the second list.
4. Add the following to your game's launch options on Steam (or add it onto the CoD4 shortcut as a launch option if you are not playing through Steam): ```+set fs_game mods/EverythingInOne```
5. Launch the game and test functionality.

If any problems arise with the installation or the mod's functionality, feel free to reach out to discord server or make an issue.
